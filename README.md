a fun way to view instagram photos, now in Angular & NodeJS.

- please see above for URL
- 'client' and 'xyz-mean' directories are the same, except 'xyz-mean' runs on minified script
- front-end and back-end are decoupled, so that they can be hosted in different places: in this case, Amazon AWS for front-end and Heroku for back-end

what might be fun to try...

- choose btween album & map view
